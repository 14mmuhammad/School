 
## Questions To Answer
- How has your age shaped your beliefs and values?
- How does it give you opportunity and choice? 
- How does it limit you?
- If your X were different, how might your perspective 
change? Your choices and opportunities? 



 
## Autobiography Draft 1
- I think that my age has played a key role in my beliefs
and values as well as the opportunities and choices I have
been able to make but it has limited me as much. My beliefs
and values have mostly come from my faith but it is up to 
me as to how I live up to them and whilst these values are
pretty basic, they are the same values that keep society
functioning. Many opportunities and choices have also come
my way, for example, whenever people find out that I am
14, they are pretty surprised since most 14 year olds don't
really focus on some stuff like this and this mainly happens 
in some talk about education or some very debatable topic. 
Another choice I get to make is about how I choose to 
work academically. Right now, it is 5AM and I am doing my
Social Studies assignment but if I wanted to, I could be
sleeping tight as well. As much as these opportunities, age
limits me in certain ways as well. One big way it limits me
is that it can allow people to change my beliefs, values or
perspective on some topic with a bit of convincing. Another 
way it limits me is that, say if I were 21, and was applying
for a job. It could be assumed that I don't have a lot of
experience related to that job when I may actually have 
done a similar job previously for quite some time. If
my age was different, I think not much would change except
for the choices and opportunities I get to make as they
would affect me on a larger scale than the ones I have
now.

## Examples
- Personally, age has shaped my beliefs and values in a way that I 
always wanted to fit in with other people and kids my age. When 
I was 11 years old, I would always want to wear trendy clothes 
instead of the childish t-shirts that included unicorns or colorful 
shapes. I believed that if I dressed a "mature" way, I would be 
"cooler" and praised for my style. I had developed my 
internalization of what I thought I was supposed to wear at that 
age. At some point, the dress code started to get more significant. 
By the time I was 13, I was always afraid of getting dress coded 
(institutional). I witnessed a few girls getting in trouble in front
of the whole class about the dress code. But now, it has made me
value fashion and the choices I make for myself. 

- My age of 11 years old allowed me to wear whatever I would like
confidently without being judged or dress coded by anyone. It gave
me a choice to express myself by having the freedom to wear whatever
I wanted. However, it did have a limit as I was getting older. 
Suddenly, when I was 13/14, I was not allowed to wear spaghetti 
straps or tops that would reveal too much of my skin to school 
(interpersonal). It changed the way I perceived my age and made me 
realize that I will not always be allowed to wear whatever I wanted 
-- especially as I got older. No schools would allow a 13-year-old 
to wear crop tops since it is not appropriate for their age.

- If my age were 20, my perspective would change immensely, and I 
would think that I am allowed to wear whatever I want since I am 
old enough to make my own decisions. But how come I was not old 
enough to decide what I wear to school in 7th grade? At age 20, I 
would have more opportunities to dress myself up without a complaint
from an older teacher. The choice to dress in any way would be fine 
since I am an adult, and it would be “age-appropriate”. I try to be 
an advocate by speaking up for many other teenagers that are dress 
coded and discuss it with an administrator. I am happy that the 
rules in AISJ have now changed in a better way.
