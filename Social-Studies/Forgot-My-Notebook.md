- How does gender and sexuality diversity impact how people 
  experience the world and the opportunities they have? 
- Really depends on where the person is. If the person is 
  in a European country would and identifies as transgender
  gets similar privileges to a CIS gender person but if 
  in say a Middle-Eastern country, that person would get 
  less privileges than CIS gender mainly due to the culture 
  and may have to do things like Caster Semenya who had to 
  get hormone therapy due to the advantage she gained over 
  her fellow athletes.
