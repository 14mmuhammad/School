## Unit 1: Energy
- GPE is the amount of energy a project has because of its position above the ground
- The GPE depends on the mass and how high above the person is
- GPE (j) = mass (kg) * gravitational field strength (newtons/kg) * height (m)
- Usually the gravitational field strength on Earth is 10 N/kg
- Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving
- KE (j) = 1/2 * mass (kg) * velocity^2 (m/s)
- Always rearrange these to find something like the mass or something:
    - m = (2KE / v^2)
    - v = sqrt(2KE / m)

- miles to km
- Speed has the greatest effect on a moving object
- Doubling mass = Doubling KE but Doubling speed/velocity = Quadrupling KE
- Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed 
- Because of the law of conservation of energy, as GPE is lost, KE is gained when an object is falling
- Gravitation field strength is the strength of gravity in a particular location
- Power = Work Done / Time Taken
- Work Done = Energy Transferred
- Work done against friction causes heat
- Work Done (joules) = Force (newtons) * Distance Moved (metres)
- Weight = mass (kg) * 10 (newtons/kg)
- Gain of KE = loss of GPE
- Power (Watts) = Work Done (Joules) / Time Took (Seconds)
- One Watt == One Joule Per Second
- Power is also = Energy Change / Time
- Power is the measure of how quickly a device does work
- The power of a device is also equal to the rate at which a device transforms energy from one form to another
- One Kilowatt motor performs 1000 joules of work per second
- If there is no specific air resistance, because of the law of conservation of energy, the GPE is converted into
KE
- Independent Variable = the thing you change, I.E. height of ball 
- Dependent Variable   = the thing you measure, I.E, the depth of crater
- Controlled Variables = things you keep the same for accuracy

- Outliers exist bruh
- To calculate outliers, use (Q_one - 1.5IQR, Q_three - 1.5IQR) 
- If you see outliers, be sure to do the experiment/trial again


## Unit 2: Digestion And Excretion
### Digestive System:
- Basic, ingestion = taking in food, digestion = breaking down of food, 
2 types mechanical and chemical

- Starts with teeth, the teeth aid in increasing the surface
area of the food by physically breaking it down
- Whilst the teeth are increasing the surface area of the food,
the salivary glands release saliva which contains an enzyme 
known as amylase and it breaks down starches. Also lubricates
the food
- Then the esophagus carries the bolus (food) from the mouth to the stomach (peristalsis)
- The stomach churns and mixes the bolus, it also produces hydrochloric 
acids, secretes pepsin (breaks down protein) and there is also mucus
which lubricates and protects the stomach walls
- Then the stomach sends the bolus into the small intestine where most of
the digestion takes place. The intestine is divided into 3 parts, the duodenum,
the jejunum and ileum. In each part something different is absorbed, the duodenum,
absorbs iron, the jejunum absorbs sugars, amino and fatty acids. Finally, the ileum
absorbs the vitamin B12, bile acids and some other nutrients. Most of the absorption
takes place in the jejunum. The small intestine also has small hair-like projections 
along the small intestine known as villi. They increase the surface area of the intestine 
therefore increasing the absorption of chemicals in the food. The small intestine is
about 20 ft long and ~3 cm in diameter. 
- Once the food has gone through the small intestine it goes through the large intestine
or the colon where it removes excess water from undigested mterial, reabsorption, only a
bit though, depends on how hydrated the body is though. The large intestine is about 5
ft long and 3 inches in diameter
- Then the food goes to the rectum and is excreted through the anus as faeces. 
- There are 3 organs that are part of the digestive system but not the tract,
these are the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. The liver is where bile is produced,
it is loaded with lipids and salts, and it dissolves and disperses droplets of fats
found in food. Then gall bladder, stores bile and is attached to the liver and small
intestine and it also absorbs water. Then there are the pancreas, they produce enzymes
such as amylase, which, breaks down starch, nuclease, which, breaks down the nucleus of
the cells from the food, lypases, which, break down lipids, and protinases which break 
down proteins. These enzymes break down carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.
It also produces sodium bicarbonat which neutralizes stomach acid. Also produces insulin, 
which regulates blood sugar. The gall bladder also drips the bile into the small
intestine.
    
### Excretory System: 
- Homeostasis is the regulation of a stable internal environment in the body. 
- Osmoregulation is how the body gets rid of the stuff it does not need.
- These processes happen as long as we are alive
- When the body is breaking down proteins, ammonia is produced
- Water is also very important for making urea which is CO2 + NH3 
- It is made up of the bladder [NOT THE GALL BLADDER], 
urethra, kidneys and ureter and skin and lungs. 
- Each cell in the body makes metabolic waste
- Urea is produced when amino acids are used for energy 
- We have 2 kidneys the size of fists in a bean shape located on 
either sides of the spinal column
- Waste filled blood enters kidney through renal artery
- As blood goes through, urea, excess water and other wastes
are removed and collected as urine
- Clean, filtered blood is returned to circulation through renal vein
- Nephrons is the main filtering unit, 1 million in each
- Blood enters nephron folowing into a small network of capillaries 
known as glomerulus
- Glomerulus is encased in a cup-shaped structure called the
Bowman's capsule. Blood is under pressure, 
the capsule is semi-permeable and fluid moves from blood into 
capsule. 
- Fluid contains water, urea, glucose, salts. No protein,
cells or platelets.
- Amino acids and glucose are return to blood stream by active 
transport
- 99% of water in Bowman's capsule returns to bloodstream
- Material remaining in nephron is called urine
- Ammonia & Urea is found in urine
- Urine flow through the ureter to the urinary bladder
- Urine is stored in bladder then released though the urethra
- Urinary Bladder:
    - Expands
    - Holds 0.6L of water
    - Larger in males than females
    - Humans produce 1.5 to 2.3L of urine every day
- The system starts with kidneys and they maintain
levels of water and dissolved materials and control
blood pressure. It filters out the fluid in the blood
and then 99% of it gets reabsorbed and 1% is peed
out. Use nephrons (1 million in each), they stretch
over 80 km, blood from heart enters kidneys from 
renal arteries and it is forced into a tangle of 
porus capillaries known as glomerulus. Starting point
for 1 nephron and the pressure is high enough to
squeeze out some of the blood into bowman's capsule
and the stuff squeezed out is called filtrate (made of
sodium, glucose, urea, water). Larger proteins 
do not get fildtered. Then the filtrate goes to 
proximal convoluted tubule. This is where  
osmoregulation and the water is reabsorbed and 
dissolved materials and a balance is created. 
Then the filtrate enters Loop of Henle which is 
a long hair pinned shaped tubule that passes thorugh
the 2 layers of the kidneys, first the renal cortex
and then the renal medulla. In the loop it extracts
most of the water we need, pumps out
salt we need and it makes the medulla more salty and 
this allows the water to be reabsorbed. The tissue
of the medula is also very salty as well and the 
lower you go, the saltier it gets. The filtrate 
then enters the second convoluted tubule and this is 
where regulation of potassium, sodium and calcium. 
Membranes porusness changes stuff. Once in the bladder
it just stays there until we piss


### Nutrients:
- Water:
    - Makes up bulk of blood
    - 90% of blood is made of water
    - Also makes up lymph, which is fluid that has been
    seeped out of the capillaries
    - 60 - 76% of body = water
    - Acts as shock absorber in spine
    - Used to flush waste
    - Urine should be mostly clear, which shows you are
    hydrated

    - 2-3 Liters at least 

- Carbohydrates:
    - Main source of energy for the body
    - Absorbed in the bloodstream
    - Ones that aren't immediately used are converted
    into glycogen and stored in liver and skeletal 
    muscles
    - Simple -> Monosaccharides, Disaccharides
    - Complex -> Polysaccharides
    - 3 types:
        - Monosaccharides => Glucose, Fructose, Galactose from fruits
        - Disaccharides   => Maltose, Lactose, Sucrose from sweets
        - Polysaccharides => Starches, Fibers, Glycogen from normal food
    - Indigestiable carbs:
        - Commonly known as fiber
        - Celluose => Helps muscles to keep food and wastes moving through
        digestive and excretory systems
        - Starch, contained in breads, pasta, cereal, rice


- Protein is made up of 20 amino acids, some of them can't be made by the body
- Calorie is the amount of energy in joules needed to heat up 1 cm cubed of water by 1 degrees Celsius 
- 1 calorie = 4.186 joules 

- Calorie:
1. Any of several approximately equal units of heat, each measured as the quantity of
heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C at 1 atmosphere pressure.


2. The unit of heat equal to 1/100 the quantity of heat required to raise the 
temperature of 1 gram of water from 0 to 100°C at 1 atmosphere pressure.

3. The unit of heat equal to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of 1 kilogram of water by 1°C at 1 atmosphere pressure.


4. A unit of energy-producing potential equal to this amount of heat that is
contained in food and released upon oxidation by the body.  

5. the gram calorie or small calorie, a non-SIunit of energy, equivalent to approximately 4.2 joules.
This unit was widely used in chemistry and physics, being the amount of energy needed to raise the 
temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 °C. 

6. kilogram calorie or large calorie. A unit of energy 1000 times larger than the gram calorie. It
is equivalent to the gram kilocalorie, approximately 4.2 kilojoules.


- Protein:
    - Supply materials for growth and repair of things like skin and muscle

- The most energy that produces is fat:
    - Carbohydrates = 4 cal/gram
    - Proteins      = 4 cal/gram
    - Fat           = 9 cal/gram

- The food becomes a bolus once it becomes chewed and mixed with saliva

## Unit 3: Electricity

- Static electricity is the charge made
by stationary friction due to differently 
charged substances or something

- Current can happened due to the movement
of negatively charged subatomic particles
called electrons through wires or the 
movemend of charged molecules by ions.

- There is a relationship between electricity
and magnetism

- Francis Hauksbee found out that spinning 
a glass globe produces electricity in the
early 1700s

- Stephen Gray & Granville Wheler discovered
that electricity could be communicated over
distances by contact.

- Nerves work based off electricity in our 
bodies.

- Copper & Zinc discs separated by a cloth
or cardboard and this generates electic 
current.

- Electric currents produce magnetic fields
- 2 parallel electified wires attract each 
other if the current flows in the same 
direction and repels in the other one.

- Amperes law, the force between currents 
was inversely propotional to distance between
them and proportional to the intensity of the
current flowing in each.

- Current between 2 points is also proportional
to the voltage or potential difference between 
them

- I = V/R:
    - I -> Current    (Amps)
    - V -> Voltage    (Volts)
    - R -> Resistance (Ohms)

- Faraday made electric magnetic motor,
caused due to magnets around an electified
wire. 

- He also said, the generation of electricity 
in one wire via the changing magnetic field 
created by the current in another. Basis for
electromagnetic technologies nowadays.

- The electricity created by magnetic 
induction, the electricity produced by 
a voltaic batter, and good old static
electricity were all the same phenomenon.

- He also theorized thaat electromagnetic 
waves travel at the speed of light, and 
that light must exist in the same medium
as electical and magnetic energy.

- J.P. Morgan's money was used by Edison
and he worked on the longest lasting filament
bulb. 

- His bulb used DC (bad safety and efficiency)

- Edison only improved on the bulbs

- Conductors and insulators, metals are all conductors
- Electric charge can be postive or negative
- The positive and negative charge of an atom is the same
- Atoms are uncharges due to the above
- Opposites attract and like repel
- Static electricity describes situation of objects that are stationary
best with insulators as well
- Current occurs when charge moves from A to B, best with conductors
- When certain insulators are rubbed against each other, they get charged
- Electrons move and protons stay stationary in an object
- The material that gains the negative charge becomes negatively charged
- The material that loses the negative charge is left with an equal positive charge
- When uncharged and charged objects come together they attract
- Different charge attracts and same charge repels
- The main danger of static electricity is a spark which can blow things up
- When oil/petrol is pumped, there can be a spark and boom, an explosion at the petrol station
as the spark is also able to burn the fuel as there is oxygen in the air
- In operating rooms, it is vital that doctors don't become statically charged
because some of the gases in the room can cause explosions as well and that is 
why antistatic floors are used
- Applications of this static electricity are paint spraying, printers,
photocopiers and smoke precipitators
- *More information on how these things work can be found in LE2*
