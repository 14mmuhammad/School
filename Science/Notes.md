- LE = Learning Engagement

## Unit 1: Energy
- GPE is the amount of energy a project has because of its position 
above the ground
- The GPE depends on the mass and how high above the person is
- GPE (j) = mass (kg) * gravitational field strength (newtons/kg) * height (m)
- Usually the gravitational field strength on Earth is 10 N/kg
- Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving
- KE (j) = 1/2 * mass (kg) * velocity^2 (m/s)
- Always rearrange these to find something like the mass or 
something:
    - m = (2KE / v^2)
    - v = sqrt(2KE / m)

- miles to km
- Speed has the greatest effect on a moving object
- Doubling mass = Doubling KE but Doubling speed/velocity = Quadrupling KE
- Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed 
- Because of the law of conservation of energy, as GPE is lost,
KE is gained when an object is falling
- Gravitation field strength is the strength of gravity in a
particular location
- Power = Work Done / Time Taken
- Work Done = Energy Transferred
- Work done against friction causes heat
- Work Done (joules) = Force (newtons) * Distance Moved (metres)
- Weight = mass (kg) * 10 (newtons/kg)
- Gain of KE = loss of GPE
- Power (Watts) = Work Done (Joules) / Time Took (Seconds)
- One Watt == One Joule Per Second
- Power is also = Energy Change / Time
- Power is the measure of how quickly a device does work
- The power of a device is also equal to the rate at which a device 
transforms energy from one form to another
- One Kilowatt motor performs 1000 joules of work per second
- If there is no specific air resistance, because of the law of
conservation of energy, the GPE is converted into KE
- Independent Variable = the thing you change, I.E. height of ball 
- Dependent Variable   = the thing you measure, I.E, the depth of
crater
- Controlled Variables = things you keep the same for accuracy
- Outliers exist bruh
- To calculate outliers, use (Q_one - 1.5IQR, Q_three - 1.5IQR) 
- If you see outliers, be sure to do the experiment/trial again


## Unit 2: Digestion And Excretion
### Digestive System:
- Basic, ingestion = taking in food, digestion = breaking down of
food, 2 types mechanical and chemical

- Starts with teeth, the teeth aid in increasing the surface
area of the food by physically breaking it down
- Whilst the teeth are increasing the surface area of the food,
the salivary glands release saliva which contains an enzyme 
known as amylase and it breaks down starches. Also lubricates
the food
- Then the esophagus carries the bolus (food) from the mouth to
the stomach (peristalsis)
- The stomach churns and mixes the bolus, it also produces 
hydrochloric  acids, secretes pepsin (breaks down protein) and 
there is also mucus which lubricates and protects the stomach walls
- Then the stomach sends the bolus into the small intestine where
most of the digestion takes place. The intestine is divided into 3 
parts, the duodenum, the jejunum and ileum. In each part something
different is absorbed, the duodenum, absorbs iron, the jejunum 
absorbs sugars, amino and fatty acids. Finally, the ileum absorbs
the vitamin B12, bile acids and some other nutrients. Most of the
absorption takes place in the jejunum. The small intestine also has 
small hair-like projections along the small intestine known as
villi. They increase the surface area of the intestine therefore 
increasing the absorption of chemicals in the food. The small 
intestine is about 20 ft long and ~3 cm in diameter. 
- Once the food has gone through the small intestine it goes 
through the large intestine or the colon where it removes excess 
water from undigested mterial, reabsorption, only a bit though, 
depends on how hydrated the body is though. The large intestine 
is about 5 ft long and 3 inches in diameter
- Then the food goes to the rectum and is excreted through the 
anus as faeces. 
- There are 3 organs that are part of the digestive system but 
not the tract, these are the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. 
The liver is where bile is produced, it is loaded with lipids
and salts, and it dissolves and disperses droplets of fats found
in food. Then gall bladder, stores bile and is attached to the
liver and small intestine and it also absorbs water. Then there
are the pancreas, they produce enzymes such as amylase, which,
breaks down starch, nuclease, which, breaks down the nucleus of 
the cells from the food, lypases, which, break down lipids, and 
protinases which break down proteins. These enzymes break down
carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. It also produces 
sodium bicarbonat which neutralizes stomach acid. Also produces
insulin, which regulates blood sugar. The gall bladder also drips
the bile into the small intestine.
    
### Excretory System: 
- Homeostasis is the regulation of a stable internal environment in 
the body. 
- Osmoregulation is how the body gets rid of the stuff it does not
need.
- These processes happen as long as we are alive
- When the body is breaking down proteins, ammonia is produced
- Water is also very important for making urea which is CO2 + NH3 
- It is made up of the bladder [NOT THE GALL BLADDER], 
urethra, kidneys and ureter and skin and lungs. 
- Each cell in the body makes metabolic waste
- Urea is produced when amino acids are used for energy 
- We have 2 kidneys the size of fists in a bean shape located on 
either sides of the spinal column
- Waste filled blood enters kidney through renal artery
- As blood goes through, urea, excess water and other wastes
are removed and collected as urine
- Clean, filtered blood is returned to circulation through renal 
vein
- Nephrons is the main filtering unit, 1 million in each
- Blood enters nephron folowing into a small network of capillaries 
known as glomerulus
- Glomerulus is encased in a cup-shaped structure called the
Bowman's capsule. Blood is under pressure, 
the capsule is semi-permeable and fluid moves from blood into 
capsule. 
- Fluid contains water, urea, glucose, salts. No protein,
cells or platelets.
- Amino acids and glucose are return to blood stream by active 
transport
- 99% of water in Bowman's capsule returns to bloodstream
- Material remaining in nephron is called urine
- Ammonia & Urea is found in urine
- Urine flow through the ureter to the urinary bladder
- Urine is stored in bladder then released though the urethra
- Urinary Bladder:
    - Expands
    - Holds 0.6L of water
    - Larger in males than females
    - Humans produce 1.5 to 2.3L of urine every day
- The system starts with kidneys and they maintain
levels of water and dissolved materials and control
blood pressure. It filters out the fluid in the blood
and then 99% of it gets reabsorbed and 1% is peed
out. Use nephrons (1 million in each), they stretch
over 80 km, blood from heart enters kidneys from 
renal arteries and it is forced into a tangle of 
porus capillaries known as glomerulus. Starting point
for 1 nephron and the pressure is high enough to
squeeze out some of the blood into bowman's capsule
and the stuff squeezed out is called filtrate (made of
sodium, glucose, urea, water). Larger proteins 
do not get fildtered. Then the filtrate goes to 
proximal convoluted tubule. This is where  
osmoregulation and the water is reabsorbed and 
dissolved materials and a balance is created. 
Then the filtrate enters Loop of Henle which is 
a long hair pinned shaped tubule that passes thorugh
the 2 layers of the kidneys, first the renal cortex
and then the renal medulla. In the loop it extracts
most of the water we need, pumps out
salt we need and it makes the medulla more salty and 
this allows the water to be reabsorbed. The tissue
of the medula is also very salty as well and the 
lower you go, the saltier it gets. The filtrate 
then enters the second convoluted tubule and this is 
where regulation of potassium, sodium and calcium. 
Membranes porusness changes stuff. Once in the bladder
it just stays there until we piss

## Unit 3: Electricity

- Static electricity is the charge made
by stationary friction due to differently 
charged substances or something

- Current can happened due to the movement
of negatively charged subatomic particles
called electrons through wires or the 
movemend of charged molecules by ions.

- There is a relationship between electricity
and magnetism

- Francis Hauksbee found out that spinning 
a glass globe produces electricity in the
early 1700s

- Stephen Gray & Granville Wheler discovered
that electricity could be communicated over
distances by contact.

- Nerves work based off electricity in our 
bodies.

- Copper & Zinc discs separated by a cloth
or cardboard and this generates electic 
current.

- Electric currents produce magnetic fields
- 2 parallel electified wires attract each 
other if the current flows in the same 
direction and repels in the other one.

- Amperes law, the force between currents 
was inversely propotional to distance between
them and proportional to the intensity of the
current flowing in each.

- Current between 2 points is also proportional
to the voltage or potential difference between 
them

- It can also be measured in joules per coulomb
- 

- I = V/R:
    - I -> Current    (Amps)
    - V -> Voltage    (Volts)
    - R -> Resistance (Ohms)

- Faraday made electric magnetic motor,
caused due to magnets around an electified
wire. 

- He also said, the generation of electricity 
in one wire via the changing magnetic field 
created by the current in another. Basis for
electromagnetic technologies nowadays.

- The electricity created by magnetic 
induction, the electricity produced by 
a voltaic batter, and good old static
electricity were all the same phenomenon.

- He also theorized thaat electromagnetic 
waves travel at the speed of light, and 
that light must exist in the same medium
as electical and magnetic energy.

- J.P. Morgan's money was used by Edison
and he worked on the longest lasting filament
bulb. 

- His bulb used DC (bad safety and efficiency)

- Edison only improved on the bulbs

- Conductors and insulators, metals are all conductors
- Conductors are the things that allow electric current to pass
through it easily. 
- Insulators are resistant to electricity
- Insulators are the things that cannot carry electric current
but can cause static electricity
- When you rub 2 insualators, electrons are pased from A to B
- Electric charge can be postive or negative
- The positive and negative charge of an atom is the same
- Atoms are uncharges due to the above
- Opposites attract and like repel
- Static electricity describes situation of objects that are 
stationary best with insulators as well
- Current occurs when charge moves from A to B, best with 
conductors
- When certain insulators are rubbed against each other, 
they get charged
- Electrons move and protons stay stationary in an object
- The material that gains the negative charge becomes negatively
charged
- The material that loses the negative charge is left with an
equal positive charge
- When uncharged and charged objects come together they attract
- Different charge attracts and same charge repels
- The main danger of static electricity is a spark which can
blow things up
- When oil/petrol is pumped, there can be a spark and boom, 
an explosion at the petrol station
as the spark is also able to burn the fuel as there is oxygen
in the air
- In operating rooms, it is vital that doctors don't become 
statically charged
because some of the gases in the room can cause explosions as
well and that is why antistatic floors are used which are made
of conductors
- Applications of this static electricity are paint spraying,
ink-jet printers, photocopiers and smoke precipitators



- ***COPY PASTED***
- The spray nozzle is connected is connected to the positive
terminal of an electrostatic generator. As the paint droplets
leave they repel each other and spread out to form a fine cloud
of paint. The metal panel to be painted is connected to the 
negative terminal. The negatively charged metal panel attracts
the positively charged paint.

- Spots of ink are given an electric charge as they leave the 
ink nozzle. The deflecting plates cause the drops to hit the
right part of the paper. The charges on the deflecting plates
change many times per second so that each drop
hits the paper in a different position.

- **ANSWER QUESTIONS**

2. Lightning is caused by the moving of frozen raindrops through the
air and when they bump into each other this results in electric 
charge. This happens and happens eventually causing the whole cloud
to be filled with electric charge. The positive charge is stored at 
the top of the cloud and the negative is stored at the bottom. As 
most of you know, opposite charges attract, the ground beneath the
cloud builds up a positive charge. The ground’s electric charge then
focuses on anything that sticks up like humans. The charge coming
from these points connects with the charge coming from the clouds
and this becomes lightning. There are many types of lightning like
Sheet lightning, Fork lightning, Heat lightning, St. Elmo’s Fire,
Ball lightning and Sprites and many more……

3. The most dangerous thing about lightning is that no one knows 
where it is going to strike and that is why it is said that you 
should stay indoors and turn off any electronic equipment in your
house so you stay safe. To stay safe you should stay away from
water and stay away from conductive equipment like outlets and other
metals. Also try to stay away from open fields and hilltops because
these places have the highest probability of charge building up and
avoid contact with the ground. Don’t stand under trees or other 
high  objects. To keep your house safe you can buy lightning rods.
Avoid showers, keep your windows closed and turn off any electronics
and stay away from them. If you are in a car put both of your hands 
on your lap, keep the windows shut and avoid contact with car and 
don’t touch the radio or something and also pull to the side of 
the road.

- 1a(I):  The cloth becomes negatively charged and the perspex rod 
becomes positively charged
- 1a(II): The cloth becomes positively charged and the rod becomes 
negatively charged
- 1b(I):  They attract because of the charge
- 1b(II): The charge is negative

- 2a:     By rubbing a cloth with it
- 2b:     Negative and Positive
- 2c:     Yes, because the different types of materials allow
electrons to be either transferred or received 
- 2d:     Repel
- 2e:     We can rub some cloth on 2 rods of different materials 
and then put them near each other to see what
happens, if they repel, they have same charge
otherwise unlike charge
- 2f:     Their atoms
- 2g:     The electrons can be transferred from one atom to another 
causing one to be negative charged and the other to be positive
- 3:  i   The hair are repelling because of them having the same
charge

electricity go to the earth
- 3:  iii Hair would not stand up

- Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge
- Electric current of one amp flows when a charge of one coulomb
passes a point in an electric circuit in one second

- In metallic conductors, electrons carry negative charge from the 
negative side of a power supple around a circuit and then back into
the positive side.

- Electric charge = current * time
- Q = IT
- Q is the electric charge (coulombs), I is the current (amps) and 
T is the time (seconds)

- Voltage of a battery is equal to the energy in joules 
provided when a charge of one coulomb passes through the 
battery
- In series, the voltage is divided amongst, in parallel 
the voltage stays the same as the start

- Voltage = Energy / Charge
- Voltage is the energy transferred per unit of charge 
- Current is the rate of flow of charge 
- 1 volt is the same as 1 joule per coulomb
- Electric current only flows if the circuit is complete, unbroken
and contains a power supply

- P = VI
- Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) * Current (Amps) 
- P = I * I * R
- Power (Watts) = Current (Amps) * Current (Amps) * Resistance (Ohm) 

- Current goes negative to positive

- If circuit components are connected in such a way that 
the current goes through each one linearly, this is a 
series circuit and all the components can be controlled
by one switch. The components also share the voltage of the 
power supply and with each bulb that is added, the previous
one gets dimmer because there is more energy being shared. 
They share the same current

- Series circuits:
- ![./res/series.png](./res/series.png)

- Parallel circuits:
- ![./res/parallel.png](./res/parallel.png)

- As you can see, in a parallel circuit, we can 
have individual switches to control each bulb as well, 
if we break the connection of one bulb, the other one 
will still work. They also allow the bulbs to be more
brighter than in a series circuit. They have the same
voltage.

- The total current is the sum of the currents through
the separate components.

- Coulomb = 6.2 * 10^18

- Benjamin Franklin was the one who said current moves positive to
negative
- [Conventional Current]
- Electroscope is that thing that opens up or something [from like that static electricity lesson]

- Resistance is the opposition to the flow of charge and is measured in ohms, also known as voltage.
- R (Ohms) = V (Volts) / I (Amps)
- To determine resistance, you need is a power supply, a variable resistor, test resistor, and 
ammeter and voltmeter. Varying the variable resistor, slowly the voltage increases, the current
also increases and the slope of this linear graph is 1/R. Meaning slope = 1/R 
- The resistance of wires:
    - The longer the wire, the greater the resistance as the electrons are going through, 
    the electrons would bump with the wire's atoms and the longer the wire, the more chance
    of bumping. 
    - The thinner the wire, the greater the resistance, as in larger area, there is more room
    to move for the electrons while in a smaller area, there is less room for the electrons to
    move

- RT = Resistance Total
- In series:
    - RT = R1 + R2
- In parallel:
    - 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2

- Current is proportional to the voltage
- V = IR
- Current is inversely proportional to resistance
- V/R = I
- Voltage is *not* proportional to current
- Important note that in parallel circuits the current is added not like in series circuits

element
- The atoms combine with ions and molecules to make up all of matter
- They are made up of 3 sub-atomic particles:

    - Protons, positive charge, in the nucleus of an atom
    - Neutrons, no charge, also in the nucleus of an atom


- Neutrons and protons have around the same mass and if we were to compare
the mass of the neutrons and protons to the electrons, the electrons' mass
seems like nothing and it is ignored. 
- An atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons and so it has no charge, though
the nucleus is positively charged
- The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in the nucleus. 
- The atomic weight of an element is found by adding the number of protons and neutrons. 
- The sub-atomic particles of protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles 
known as quarks
- The smallest possible sub-atomic particle though is the electron as it is smaller than a proton and neutron
- There is a theory that talks about strings being the smallest possible piece of matter as they connect the
quarks together to form the sub-atomic particles or something. [Link](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/string-theory-explained)

- There are six types of quarks (known as flavors (???)): 
    - up 
    - down 
    - charm 
    - strange 
    - top
    - bottom.

- They come in 3 colors representing their force: red, blue and green. Up and down quarks are the most common and
least massive. Protons are made up of one down and two up quarks, while neutrons are made up of one down and two 
up quarks.
- There also exists antimatter...

- Everything is made of atoms
- Discovery of atoms caused many people to rethink their theories 
- Ludwig Boltzmann was the first one to argue that atoms are basic 
building blocks of matter and arguing about atoms was considered a 
waste of time a century ago due to technology. 
- Understanding how atoms work was key to using engines efficiently
- People believed that it was an insult to boil down God's miracle to
a bunch of small spheres
- Albert Einstein would go onto publish a paper about how tiny pollens 
of grain would dance around and not float as if they were alive. Before
him Robert Brown had also conducted this experiment but it was ignored  
by many. 
- Einstein argued in the paper that the pollen would only jiggle if they 
were being jossled by tiny particles that are jiggling themselves now known
as atoms. If there were no atoms, the pollen would stay still. He also said
for brownian motion to occur, atoms must exist
- [Just a comment from me, not from the video] We know that there are 3 
states of matter, well 4 but we are going to ignore that for now. Solid
states of matter have their atoms tightly packed together therefore 
explaining why things stay still whilst on them. In liquids, the atoms are
still packed together but not as tightly and so they can move around. This
phenomenon can also be seen when melting a solid, the atoms start to 
vibrate very quickly and stuff. So as the atoms have room to move around,
it would explain why the pollen starts to move around or dance around 
and the same goes for gaseous states of matter. That I guess explains the
whole experiment. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. Just remember density matters as well as
the solid may sometimes just sink towards the bottom of the water due to 
gravity and stuff as well.
- Einstein would also go onto prove that the dance of the pollen revealed the 
size of the atom using some quick mafs. 
- Manchester would become the center of nuclear physics
- Neils Bohr and Ernest Rutherford would work together in the 1910s. They had
completely different methods of working but did have the same goal 
- In the 1890s, X-Rays were discovered in Germany. A few years later in Cambridge
it would be shown that powerful currents could produce strange streams of tiny
charged glowing particles called electrons. 
- In 1896, The metal Uranium would also be known as radioactive and it would be 
able to pass through solids.
- Rutherford was fascinated by this and he would have his assisstants an 
experiment in 1909. The materials would be, a very very thin gold leaf, a 
moveable fluorescent screen that is flashed when hit by radioactive rays and 
a box that contained the radioactive metal known as Radium. It would be a 
powerful source of a radioactivity known to Rutherford as alpha rays and it
was more like a stream of particles and it would output them like a machine gun.
The experiment was simple, use the Radium gun to shoot at the gold leaf and 
with the fluorescent plate count the number of particles that come out the 
other side. His assisstants would keep on doing this for weeks and the particles
seemed to punch through the leaf as if it wasn't there and sometimes they would
just swerve slightly while going through. Rutherford would be told by his 
assisstant that they had seen nothing unusual. He would ask his assisstant to
check if there were any alpha particles were bouncing back to the gun. His 
assisstants would spend a LOT of time doing this. Nothing interesting happened
until once, it would be seen that the 1/8000 particles would bounce back. 
Rutherford would go onto prove the subatomic layer and would picture the atom
as a solar system and the electrons would orbit around the center/nucleus. 
Rutherford's atom though, was a contradictory one to the laws of science
as his model of it consisted of mainly empty space and the electrons revolving
around the nucleus would be rather distanced from it. 

- Many scientists would argue as many disagreed with Rutherford's model and propose their own. Bohr
would then come from Denmark to Manchester. Bohr would use not matter but light
to find the properties of atoms. Bohr intended to replace Rutherford's model
with something knwon as quantum jump. Bohr defined the atom as more of a 
building. The ground floor was where the nucleus was and the electrons would live
on the floors and not in between them. The electrons could jump from one floor to
another and this would be known as quantum jumps. When electrons jump from a 
higher floor to lower one, light is given off and the color depends on how long
the jump is. 

- Scientists would argue again. Einstein hated Bohr's idea. Then Heisenburg and 
Shcrodinger would have conflicting ideas. Shcrodinger was a very interesting man... 
He would have multiple girlfriends throughout his married life and in 1925, Shcrodinger 
would stay at a hotel and spend time with an old girlfriend of his and throughout this 
time he would come up with the idea that the electron was a wave of energy that was 
vibrating so fast that it would look like a cloud and came with an equation that would discribe this vibration. 
This equation would be known as Shcrodinger's Wave equation. The idea still
couldn't explain Bohr's quantum jump though. 

- Heisenburg would be going to an island at the north coast of Germany and would work on Shcrodinger's idea and
Bohr's idea. He believed it was time to give up the picture of the atom which
many deterred. He decided to use maths to understand the behaviour of it but 
would later understand that the atom defied visualizations and traditional 
maths. He would then learn that he would have to use a certain type of mathematics, 
(me, talking now, not the video) in a nutshell, say you have 2 numbers 3 and 4
and you multiply them, you get 12, you can multiply them 3 x 4 and 4 x 3 meaning
the order does not matter but for atoms, the order matters. I haven't watched the
next few seconds of the video but from what I know about Maths so far, this type 
of mathematics is represented by matrices which are n x m and they can be used
to represent many things. If you were to multiple matrix A and B, you would get 
a different result than doing B x A. Back to the video now, he would then go back
to his university and would work with his colleague, Max Borne about it and they 
would go onto make a new theory of the atom now known as matrix mechanics. Heisenburg 
and his mentor would be able to accurately atomic behaviour but for the traditionalists,
"it was pure heresy" as a mere array of numbers or a matrix could not represent an 
atom. (me, talking now) To summarize, some of these physicists really hated each other
like Shcrodinger and Heisenburg. 

- When Shcrodinger was going to give his lecture, 
Heisenburg would go there and attack Shcrodinger's methods. Heisenburg at the end of 
the lecture would object to Shcrodinger's idea yet he would be booed and would have
to leave. The whole scientific world was against Bohr and Heisenburg. They both would
argue about quantum mechanics and then Heisenburg would understand that there was a
limit on how much a human can know about the sub-atomic world, we can know where an 
electron is at a particular moment in time, we cannot know how fast it is moving, but
if we knew its speed, we would know its position. This is what is known as Heisenburg's
Uncertainty principle. Atoms behave like waves and particles. If you don't look at them
they are like spread out waves but if you do look at them, they behave like a particle.
Bohr's interpretation of the atom would be known as the Copenhagen interpretation.
