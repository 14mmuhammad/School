## Unit 1: Energy
- GPE is the amount of energy a project has because of its position above the ground
- The GPE depends on the mass and how high above the person is
- GPE (j) = mass (kg) * gravitational field strength (newtons/kg) * height (m)
- Usually the gravitational field strength on Earth is 10 N/kg
- Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving
- KE (j) = 1/2 * mass (kg) * velocity^2 (m/s)
- Always rearrange these to find something like the mass or something:
    - m = (2KE / v^2)
    - v = sqrt(2KE / m)

- miles to km
- Speed has the greatest effect on a moving object
- Doubling mass = Doubling KE but Doubling speed/velocity = Quadrupling KE
- Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed 
- Because of the law of conservation of energy, as GPE is lost, KE is gained when an object is falling
- Gravitation field strength is the strength of gravity in a particular location
- Power = Work Done / Time Taken
- Work Done = Energy Transferred
- Work done against friction causes heat
- Work Done (joules) = Force (newtons) * Distance Moved (metres)
- Weight = mass (kg) * 10 (newtons/kg)
- Gain of KE = loss of GPE
- Power (Watts) = Work Done (Joules) / Time Took (Seconds)
- One Watt == One Joule Per Second
- Power is also = Energy Change / Time
- Power is the measure of how quickly a device does work
- The power of a device is also equal to the rate at which a device transforms energy from one form to another
- One Kilowatt motor performs 1000 joules of work per second
- If there is no specific air resistance, because of the law of conservation of energy, the GPE is converted into
KE
- Independent Variable = the thing you change, I.E. height of ball 
- Dependent Variable   = the thing you measure, I.E, the depth of crater
- Controlled Variables = things you keep the same for accuracy

- Outliers exist bruh
- To calculate outliers, use (Q_one - 1.5IQR, Q_three - 1.5IQR) 
- If you see outliers, be sure to do the experiment/trial again


## Unit 2: Digestion And Excretion
### Digestive System:
- Basic, ingestion = taking in food, digestion = breaking down of food, 
2 types mechanical and chemical

- Starts with teeth, the teeth aid in increasing the surface
area of the food by physically breaking it down
- Whilst the teeth are increasing the surface area of the food,
the salivary glands release saliva which contains an enzyme 
known as amylase and it breaks down starches. Also lubricates
the food
- Then the esophagus carries the bolus (food) from the mouth to the stomach (peristalsis)
- The stomach churns and mixes the bolus, it also produces hydrochloric 
acids, secretes pepsin (breaks down protein) and there is also mucus
which lubricates and protects the stomach walls
- Then the stomach sends the bolus into the small intestine where most of
the digestion takes place. The intestine is divided into 3 parts, the duodenum,
the jejunum and ileum. In each part something different is absorbed, the duodenum,
absorbs iron, the jejunum absorbs sugars, amino and fatty acids. Finally, the ileum
absorbs the vitamin B12, bile acids and some other nutrients. Most of the absorption
takes place in the jejunum. The small intestine also has small hair-like projections 
along the small intestine known as villi. They increase the surface area of the intestine 
therefore increasing the absorption of chemicals in the food. The small intestine is
about 20 ft long and ~3 cm in diameter. 
- Once the food has gone through the small intestine it goes through the large intestine
or the colon where it removes excess water from undigested mterial, reabsorption, only a
bit though, depends on how hydrated the body is though. The large intestine is about 5
ft long and 3 inches in diameter
- Then the food goes to the rectum and is excreted through the anus as faeces. 
- There are 3 organs that are part of the digestive system but not the tract,
these are the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. The liver is where bile is produced,
it is loaded with lipids and salts, and it dissolves and disperses droplets of fats
found in food. Then gall bladder, stores bile and is attached to the liver and small
intestine and it also absorbs water. Then there are the pancreas, they produce enzymes
such as amylase, which, breaks down starch, nuclease, which, breaks down the nucleus of
the cells from the food, lypases, which, break down lipids, and protinases which break 
down proteins. These enzymes break down carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.
It also produces sodium bicarbonat which neutralizes stomach acid. Also produces insulin, 
which regulates blood sugar. The gall bladder also drips the bile into the small
intestine.
    
### Excretory System: 
- Homeostasis is the regulation of a stable internal environment in the body. 
- Osmoregulation is how the body gets rid of the stuff it does not need.
- These processes happen as long as we are alive
- When the body is breaking down proteins, ammonia is produced
- Water is also very important for making urea which is CO2 + NH3 
- It is made up of the bladder [NOT THE GALL BLADDER], 
urethra, kidneys and ureter and skin and lungs. 
- Each cell in the body makes metabolic waste
- Urea is produced when amino acids are used for energy 
- We have 2 kidneys the size of fists in a bean shape located on 
either sides of the spinal column
- Waste filled blood enters kidney through renal artery
- As blood goes through, urea, excess water and other wastes
are removed and collected as urine
- Clean, filtered blood is returned to circulation through renal vein
- Nephrons is the main filtering unit, 1 million in each
- Blood enters nephron folowing into a small network of capillaries 
known as glomerulus
- Glomerulus is encased in a cup-shaped structure called the
Bowman's capsule. Blood is under pressure, 
the capsule is semi-permeable and fluid moves from blood into 
capsule. 
- Fluid contains water, urea, glucose, salts. No protein,
cells or platelets.
- Amino acids and glucose are return to blood stream by active 
transport
- 99% of water in Bowman's capsule returns to bloodstream
- Material remaining in nephron is called urine
- Ammonia & Urea is found in urine
- Urine flow through the ureter to the urinary bladder
- Urine is stored in bladder then released though the urethra
- Urinary Bladder:
    - Expands
    - Holds 0.6L of water
    - Larger in males than females
    - Humans produce 1.5 to 2.3L of urine every day
- The system starts with kidneys and they maintain
levels of water and dissolved materials and control
blood pressure. It filters out the fluid in the blood
and then 99% of it gets reabsorbed and 1% is peed
out. Use nephrons (1 million in each), they stretch
over 80 km, blood from heart enters kidneys from 
renal arteries and it is forced into a tangle of 
porus capillaries known as glomerulus. Starting point
for 1 nephron and the pressure is high enough to
squeeze out some of the blood into bowman's capsule
and the stuff squeezed out is called filtrate (made of
sodium, glucose, urea, water). Larger proteins 
do not get fildtered. Then the filtrate goes to 
proximal convoluted tubule. This is where  
osmoregulation and the water is reabsorbed and 
dissolved materials and a balance is created. 
Then the filtrate enters Loop of Henle which is 
a long hair pinned shaped tubule that passes thorugh
the 2 layers of the kidneys, first the renal cortex
and then the renal medulla. In the loop it extracts
most of the water we need, pumps out
salt we need and it makes the medulla more salty and 
this allows the water to be reabsorbed. The tissue
of the medula is also very salty as well and the 
lower you go, the saltier it gets. The filtrate 
then enters the second convoluted tubule and this is 
where regulation of potassium, sodium and calcium. 
Membranes porusness changes stuff. Once in the bladder
it just stays there until we piss

## Unit 3: Electricity

- Static electricity is the charge made
by stationary friction due to differently 
charged substances or something

- Current can happened due to the movement
of negatively charged subatomic particles
called electrons through wires or the 
movemend of charged molecules by ions.

- There is a relationship between electricity
and magnetism

- Francis Hauksbee found out that spinning 
a glass globe produces electricity in the
early 1700s

- Stephen Gray & Granville Wheler discovered
that electricity could be communicated over
distances by contact.

- Nerves work based off electricity in our 
bodies.

- Copper & Zinc discs separated by a cloth
or cardboard and this generates electic 
current.

- Electric currents produce magnetic fields
- 2 parallel electified wires attract each 
other if the current flows in the same 
direction and repels in the other one.

- Amperes law, the force between currents 
was inversely propotional to distance between
them and proportional to the intensity of the
current flowing in each.

- Current between 2 points is also proportional
to the voltage or potential difference between 
them

- It can also be measured in joules per coulomb
- 

- I = V/R:
    - I -> Current    (Amps)
    - V -> Voltage    (Volts)
    - R -> Resistance (Ohms)

- Faraday made electric magnetic motor,
caused due to magnets around an electified
wire. 

- He also said, the generation of electricity 
in one wire via the changing magnetic field 
created by the current in another. Basis for
electromagnetic technologies nowadays.

- The electricity created by magnetic 
induction, the electricity produced by 
a voltaic batter, and good old static
electricity were all the same phenomenon.

- He also theorized thaat electromagnetic 
waves travel at the speed of light, and 
that light must exist in the same medium
as electical and magnetic energy.

- J.P. Morgan's money was used by Edison
and he worked on the longest lasting filament
bulb. 

- His bulb used DC (bad safety and efficiency)

- Edison only improved on the bulbs

- Conductors and insulators, metals are all conductors
- Conductors are the things that allow electric current to pass through it easily. 
- Insulators are resistant to electricity
- Insulators are the things that cannot carry electric current but can cause static electricity
- When you rub 2 insualators, electrons are pased from A to B
- Electric charge can be postive or negative
- The positive and negative charge of an atom is the same
- Atoms are uncharges due to the above
- Opposites attract and like repel
- Static electricity describes situation of objects that are stationary
best with insulators as well
- Current occurs when charge moves from A to B, best with conductors
- When certain insulators are rubbed against each other, they get charged
- Electrons move and protons stay stationary in an object
- The material that gains the negative charge becomes negatively charged
- The material that loses the negative charge is left with an equal positive charge
- When uncharged and charged objects come together they attract
- Different charge attracts and same charge repels
- The main danger of static electricity is a spark which can blow things up
- When oil/petrol is pumped, there can be a spark and boom, an explosion at the petrol station
as the spark is also able to burn the fuel as there is oxygen in the air
- In operating rooms, it is vital that doctors don't become statically charged
because some of the gases in the room can cause explosions as well and that is 
why antistatic floors are used which are made of conductors
- Applications of this static electricity are paint spraying, ink-jet printers,
photocopiers and smoke precipitators



- ***COPY PASTED***
- The spray nozzle is connected is connected to the positive terminal of an electrostatic generator.
As the paint droplets leave they repel each other and spread out to form a fine cloud of paint.
The metal panel to be painted is connected to the negative terminal.
The negatively charged metal panel attracts the positively charged paint.

- Spots of ink are given an electric charge as they leave the ink nozzle.
The deflecting plates cause the drops to hit the right part of the paper.
The charges on the deflecting plates change many times per second so that each drop
hits the paper in a different position.

- **ANSWER QUESTIONS**

2. Lightning is caused by the moving of frozen raindrops through the air and when they bump into each other this results in electric charge. This happens and happens eventually causing the whole cloud to be filled with electric charge. The positive charge is stored at the top of the cloud and the negative is stored at the bottom. As most of you know, opposite charges attract, the ground beneath the cloud builds up a positive charge. The ground’s electric charge then focuses on anything that sticks up like humans. The charge coming from these points connects with the charge coming from the clouds and this becomes lightning. There are many types of lightning like Sheet lightning, Fork lightning, Heat lightning, St. Elmo’s Fire, Ball lightning and Sprites and many more……

3. The most dangerous thing about lightning is that no one knows where it is going to strike and that is why it is said that you should stay indoors and turn off any electronic equipment in your house so you stay safe. To stay safe you should stay away from water and stay away from conductive equipment like outlets and other metals. Also try to stay away from open fields and hilltops because these places have the highest probability of charge building up and avoid contact with the ground. Don’t stand under trees or other high objects. To keep your house safe you can buy lightning rods. Avoid showers, keep your windows closed and turn off any electronics and stay away from them. If you are in a car put both of your hands on your lap, keep the windows shut and avoid contact with car and don’t touch the radio or something and also pull to the side of the road.

- 1a(I):  The cloth becomes negatively charged and the perspex rod becomes positively charged
- 1a(II): The cloth becomes positively charged and the rod becomes negatively charged
- 1b(I):  They attract because of the charge
- 1b(II): The charge is negative
- 1c(I):  Due to them being samely charged
- 1c(II): Due to them being oppositely charged
- 2a:     By rubbing a cloth with it
- 2b:     Negative and Positive
- 2c:     Yes, because the different types of materials allow electrons to be either transferred or received 
- 2d:     Repel
- 2e:     We can rub some cloth on 2 rods of different materials and then put them near each other to see what
          happens, if they repel, they have same charge otherwise unlike charge
- 2f:     Their atoms
- 2g:     The electrons can be transferred from one atom to another causing one to be negative charged and 
          the other to be positive
- 3:  i   The hair are repelling because of them having the same charge
- 3:  ii  Because it is an insulator and does not allow the electricity go to the earth
- 3:  iii Hair would not stand up

- Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge
- Electric current of one amp flows when a charge of one coulomb
passes a point in an electric circuit in one second

- In metallic conductors, electrons carry negative charge from the 
negative side of a power supple around a circuit and then back into
the positive side.

- Electric charge = current * time
- Q = IT
- Q is the electric charge (coulombs), I is the current (amps) and 
T is the time (seconds)

- Voltage of a battery is equal to the energy in joules 
provided when a charge of one coulomb passes through the 
battery
- In series, the voltage is divided amongst, in parallel 
the voltage stays the same as the start

- Voltage = Energy / Charge
- Voltage definition -------
- Current definition -------
- 1 volt is the same as 1 joule per coulomb
- Electric current only flows if the circuit is complete, unbroken
and contains a power supply

- P = VI
- Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) * Current (Amps) 
- P = I * I * R
- Power (Watts) = Current (Amps) * Current (Amps) * Resistance (Ohm) 

- Current goes negative to positive

- If circuit components are connected in such a way that 
the current goes through each one linearly, this is a 
series circuit and all the components can be controlled
by one switch. The components also share the voltage of the 
power supply and with each bulb that is added, the previous
one gets dimmer because there is more energy being shared. 
They share the same current

- Series circuits:
- ![./res/series.png](./res/series.png)

- Parallel circuits:
- ![./res/parallel.png](./res/parallel.png)

- As you can see, in a parallel circuit, we can 
have individual switches to control each bulb as well, 
if we break the connection of one bulb, the other one 
will still work. They also allow the bulbs to be more
brighter than in a series circuit. They have the same
voltage.

- The total current is the sum of the currents through
the separate components.
