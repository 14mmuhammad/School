- Atom is the smallest possible unit of matter that still retains or has the properties of a certain chemical
element
- The atoms combine with ions and molecules to make up all of matter
- They are made up of 3 sub-atomic particles:
    - Electrons, negative charge, go around the shell of the atom
    - Protons, positive charge, in the nucleus of an atom
    - Neutrons, no charge, also in the nucleus of an atom


- Neutrons and protons have around the same mass and if we were to compare
the mass of the neutrons and protons to the electrons, the electrons' mass
seems like nothing and it is ignored. 
- An atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons and so it has no charge, though
the nucleus is positively charged
- The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in the nucleus. 
- The atomic weight of an element is found by adding the number of protons and neutrons. 
- The sub-atomic particles of protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles 
known as quarks
- The smallest possible sub-atomic particle though is the electron as it is smaller than a proton and neutron
- There is a theory that talks about strings being the smallest possible piece of matter as they connect the
quarks together to form the sub-atomic particles or something. [Link](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/string-theory-explained)

- There are six types of quarks (known as flavors (???)): 
    - up 
    - down 
    - charm 
    - strange 
    - top
    - bottom.

- They come in 3 colors representing their force: red, blue and green. Up and down quarks are the most common and
least massive. Protons are made up of one down and two up quarks, while neutrons are made up of one down and two 
up quarks.
- There also exists antimatter...

- Everything is made of atoms
- Discovery of atoms caused many people to rethink their theories 
- Ludwig Boltzmann was the first one to argue that atoms are basic 
building blocks of matter and arguing about atoms was considered a 
waste of time a century ago due to technology. 
- Understanding how atoms work was key to using engines efficiently
- People believed that it was an insult to boil down God's miracle to
a bunch of small spheres
- Albert Einstein would go onto publish a paper about how tiny pollens 
of grain would dance around and not float as if they were alive. Before
him Robert Brown had also conducted this experiment but it was ignored  
by many. 
- Einstein argued in the paper that the pollen would only jiggle if they 
were being jossled by tiny particles that are jiggling themselves now known
as atoms. If there were no atoms, the pollen would stay still. He also said
for brownian motion to occur, atoms must exist
- [Just a comment from me, not from the video] We know that there are 3 
states of matter, well 4 but we are going to ignore that for now. Solid
states of matter have their atoms tightly packed together therefore 
explaining why things stay still whilst on them. In liquids, the atoms are
still packed together but not as tightly and so they can move around. This
phenomenon can also be seen when melting a solid, the atoms start to 
vibrate very quickly and stuff. So as the atoms have room to move around,
it would explain why the pollen starts to move around or dance around 
and the same goes for gaseous states of matter. That I guess explains the
whole experiment. `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`. Just remember density matters as well as
the solid may sometimes just sink towards the bottom of the water due to 
gravity and stuff as well.
- Einstein would also go onto prove that the dance of the pollen revealed the 
size of the atom using some quick mafs. 
- Manchester would become the center of nuclear physics
- Neils Bohr and Ernest Rutherford would work together in the 1910s. They had
completely different methods of working but did have the same goal 
- In the 1890s, X-Rays were discovered in Germany. A few years later in Cambridge
it would be shown that powerful currents could produce strange streams of tiny
charged glowing particles called electrons. 
- In 1896, The metal Uranium would also be known as radioactive and it would be 
able to pass through solids.
- Rutherford was fascinated by this and he would have his assisstants an 
experiment in 1909. The materials would be, a very very thin gold leaf, a 
moveable fluorescent screen that is flashed when hit by radioactive rays and 
a box that contained the radioactive metal known as Radium. It would be a 
powerful source of a radioactivity known to Rutherford as alpha rays and it
was more like a stream of particles and it would output them like a machine gun.
The experiment was simple, use the Radium gun to shoot at the gold leaf and 
with the fluorescent plate count the number of particles that come out the 
other side. His assisstants would keep on doing this for weeks and the particles
seemed to punch through the leaf as if it wasn't there and sometimes they would
just swerve slightly while going through. Rutherford would be told by his 
assisstant that they had seen nothing unusual. He would ask his assisstant to
check if there were any alpha particles were bouncing back to the gun. His 
assisstants would spend a LOT of time doing this. Nothing interesting happened
until once, it would be seen that the 1/8000 particles would bounce back. 
Rutherford would go onto prove the subatomic layer and would picture the atom
as a solar system and the electrons would orbit around the center/nucleus. 
Rutherford's atom though, was a contradictory one to the laws of science
as his model of it consisted of mainly empty space and the electrons revolving
around the nucleus would be rather distanced from it. 

- Many scientists would argue as many disagreed with Rutherford's model and propose their own. Bohr
would then come from Denmark to Manchester. Bohr would use not matter but light
to find the properties of atoms. Bohr intended to replace Rutherford's model
with something knwon as quantum jump. Bohr defined the atom as more of a 
building. The ground floor was where the nucleus was and the electrons would live
on the floors and not in between them. The electrons could jump from one floor to
another and this would be known as quantum jumps. When electrons jump from a 
higher floor to lower one, light is given off and the color depends on how long
the jump is. 

- Scientists would argue again. Einstein hated Bohr's idea. Then Heisenburg and 
Shcrodinger would have conflicting ideas. Shcrodinger was a very interesting man... 
He would have multiple girlfriends throughout his married life and in 1925, Shcrodinger 
would stay at a hotel and spend time with an old girlfriend of his and throughout this 
time he would come up with the idea that the electron was a wave of energy that was 
vibrating so fast that it would look like a cloud and came with an equation that would discribe this vibration. 
This equation would be known as Shcrodinger's Wave equation. The idea still
couldn't explain Bohr's quantum jump though. 

- Heisenburg would be going to an island at the north coast of Germany and would work on Shcrodinger's idea and
Bohr's idea. He believed it was time to give up the picture of the atom which
many deterred. He decided to use maths to understand the behaviour of it but 
would later understand that the atom defied visualizations and traditional 
maths. He would then learn that he would have to use a certain type of mathematics, 
(me, talking now, not the video) in a nutshell, say you have 2 numbers 3 and 4
and you multiply them, you get 12, you can multiply them 3 x 4 and 4 x 3 meaning
the order does not matter but for atoms, the order matters. I haven't watched the
next few seconds of the video but from what I know about Maths so far, this type 
of mathematics is represented by matrices which are n x m and they can be used
to represent many things. If you were to multiple matrix A and B, you would get 
a different result than doing B x A. Back to the video now, he would then go back
to his university and would work with his colleague, Max Borne about it and they 
would go onto make a new theory of the atom now known as matrix mechanics. Heisenburg 
and his mentor would be able to accurately atomic behaviour but for the traditionalists,
"it was pure heresy" as a mere array of numbers or a matrix could not represent an 
atom. (me, talking now) To summarize, some of these physicists really hated each other
like Shcrodinger and Heisenburg. 

- When Shcrodinger was going to give his lecture, 
Heisenburg would go there and attack Shcrodinger's methods. Heisenburg at the end of 
the lecture would object to Shcrodinger's idea yet he would be booed and would have
to leave. The whole scientific world was against Bohr and Heisenburg. They both would
argue about quantum mechanics and then Heisenburg would understand that there was a
limit on how much a human can know about the sub-atomic world, we can know where an 
electron is at a particular moment in time, we cannot know how fast it is moving, but
if we knew its speed, we would know its position. This is what is known as Heisenburg's
Uncertainty principle. Atoms behave like waves and particles. If you don't look at them
they are like spread out waves but if you do look at them, they behave like a particle.
Bohr's interpretation of the atom would be known as the Copenhagen interpretation.
