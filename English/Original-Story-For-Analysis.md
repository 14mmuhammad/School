The Crooks

by Gabriel Okara

The two men stood out from the crowd that they were 
walking through. Their hair was all brown with dust. 
The clothes they had on were dirty and torn. Their 
bare feet were as dirty and as brown as their hair. 
The only luggage they had was a bulging haversack. 
It was neatly buckled down, and one of them carried it
on his shoulder as they walked along the bridge
towards Idumota. They were two men who had apparently 
just arrived from the Provinces by lorry.

Traders arriving dirty and dusty from head to foot,
and carrying haversacks, are a familiar sight in 
Lagos. But these two had an air about them of being in
a strange place. They walked one behind the other as 
if they were picking their way in the forest. They 
avoided bodily contact with the people walking briskly
to and fro past them, and were startled over and over 
again by the strident horns of the cars. They gaped at
the lagoon and at the stream of cars, motorcycles and 
bicycles rushing in both directions across the 
gigantic bridge. Their eyes were wide with 
astonishment at the greatness of the city, the great
noise and the great building and the great amount of
people in this new town. 

On the side, a man was cycling leisurely along on a
brand new green bicycle from the Idumota end of the 
bridge. His shirt and trousers were a dazzling white, 
and his two-tone black and white shoes were spotless. 
Tilted over his forehead was a white cork helmet. He
put on his brakes as his practised eyes caught the two
men on the other side, stopping now and again to allow
people to pass, or looking for an opening through the 
milling throng on the pavement. The man on the bicycle
studied them for a few minutes from his side of the
bridge and waited for a break in the traffic. His eyes
never left them, not for a moment. An old car wheezed 
past and its groaning disappeared in the distance. He 
looked quickly left and then right. He saw that
another car was approaching, but he dashed across
narrowly missing death. Safe on the other side, he
cycled up to the two dirty men, with the haversack.

‘Hello,’ he said with a broad smile.

The two men were startled and moved on faster. 

‘I know you for somewhere,’ he said smiling. ‘I tink 
na Enugu. I get friend dere and you resembl’am.’

The man carrying the haversack moved nervously closer 
to the railings and the other man moved in front of 
him, as if protecting something, he then turned to
the cyclist, looking at him with what looked like 
apprehension, in his eyes, and he said: ‘Yes na from
Enugu we come. You go for Enugu before?’ ‘Yes,’
the cyclist said, excited that he had managed to get
the man to talk to him, he knew he was winning over
his trust. ‘I stay for Enugu long time. Okonkwo be my 
big friend an’ you resembl’am for face. You be him 
broder?’

‘Yes,’ said the stranger, ‘one Okonkwo be one farder
one moder with me. He be big contractor for Enugu 
an’ we stay for Asata. Na him be your frien’?’

‘Ah! na him,’ said the cyclist, ‘we be big frien’s. 
All the lorry wey he get na me arrange for ‘am. I be
agent for lorry. Dis na firs’ time you come for 
Lagos?’ ‘Yes, did na firs’ time an’ na lorry I wan
buy sef.’

‘Ah you be lucky man,’ said the cyclist. ‘Waiten be 
your name?’

‘Okonkwo.’

‘An’ your friend’?’

‘Okeke.’

‘You be lucky man. Na sorry I go give person for 
Ebute Metta jus’ now. Na God make wey you meet me. 
Wayo plenty for here. They for wayo you an’ take your
money for nothin. How many lorry you wan’ buy?’

‘Na only one,’ said Okonkwo.

‘Na only one you want. I go fit arrange am quick for
you if na today or tomorrow. Only today late small. 
But tomorrow I go fit gettam for you easy …
You get place for stay?’

‘The person wey I know, I no know the place he stay.
But we go look for am,’ said Okonkwo. 

‘Make you no worry,’ said the cyclist. ‘You stay for 
my place. Your broder be my big frien’ and he go vex
when he hear say I see you an’ no keep you or my
house. Come we go.’

At this invitation, Okonkwo shook his head and said: 
‘I fear for did town. They tell me say wayo plenty.
I no know you. You say you be my broder frien’ but I
dey fear.’ 

The cyclist smiled to himself because he had guessed 
correctly about these two travellers.

‘You right,’ said the cyclist, ‘you right for fear. 
But your broder an’ me be big frien’s an even e write 
me letter say him broder dey come. I forget for tell
you de firs’ time I see you. So make you no fear. Na 
God make wey I see you.’

‘I dey fear O,’ said Okonkwo. ‘I dey fear but make I
tell Okeke firs’.’ With this he went over to Okeke and
told him. But Okeke was still very wary of this 
stranger on the bicycle and he replied with a vigorous
shake of his head and said loudly that it was all a 
trick to get their money. But after much persuasion 
he reluctantly agreed and they went with the cyclist. 

It was evening. Okonkwo and Okeke had eaten a 
well-pounded foofoo and egusi specially prepared 
for them and were sitting close together with the 
haversack between them in their host’s parlour. They
had not let the haversack out of their sight and 
were hanging on to it as if it was very valuable. 

Their host, who had been out for a short time, had
just come in with a party of other people. The 
newcomers were dressed in heavily embroidered velvet
agbadas and slippers.

‘Dis na my frien’s,’ their host said, introducing the 
people to Okonkwo and Okeke. ‘I tell dem say I get big
‘tranger so they come salute you. All be big people. 
Na we dey sell motor for dis town.’

As the men went forward to shake hands with them, 
Okonkwo and Okeke looked awed, and fidgeted. They 
looked overwhelmed with the formality of the 
situation. The hand-shaking over, their host 
beckoned one of his friends into his bedroom.

‘You see how them be?’ he said after shutting the 
door. ‘They be moo-moo and they get plenty money in
that bag of theirs, do you see how they hold onto it 
like it is something of great value. Now listen 
carefully to me, ‘as I say to you before, we are 
going to play big with them. We go make them win
hundred ‘redboys’. When you wan’ big fish you use
big hook, and big bait. So you know waiten you go 
do. Tomorrow we go rich!’ Then he opened a small 
wooden box and bringing out three cards said, ‘Dis
na the cards,’ as he handed them over to his partner 
who took them and put them in his pocket. Then the
two men went back into the parlour to join the 
others.  Soon drinks were produced from their
bag-like pockets and as they drank and boasted of
their riches the cards were brought out. They invited 
Okonkwo and Okeke to play, but they refused as they
didn’t know how. 

‘Very easy,’ said the man with the cards. ‘When I 
cuttam, puttam for groun’ you pick dis one,’ showing
them an ace of spades as he continued. ‘You pick did
one you win, you pick another I win: easy you see.’

Still Okonkwo and Okeke were reluctant, but they soon 
seemed to become impressed by the easy way some of 
the people won money, and joined the game. ‘Na one 
one poun’,’ said the man with cards. ‘Put your money
for groun’. You take dis you win, you take dis you 
lose.’ Okonkwo and Okeke watched carefully as the man 
cut the cards and put them face downwards on the
floor. After studying them for a minute or two
Okonkwo picked a card. It was the ace of spades and so
he won. So it went on until Okonkwo and Okeke had won 
one hundred pounds between them. ‘E do now,’ said the 
host as the hundredth pound was being handed over to 
Okonkwo and Okeke. ‘Edo now. You be lucky people. 
Tomorrow you go get lorry.’ So they stopped playing 
and the people left. The host also went to bed after
showing Okonkwo and Okeke a place to sleep on the 
parlour floor. 

When he thought that Okonkwo and Okeke would be 
asleep, their host opened the door of the parlour 
quietly and peered in. He saw that the haversack was 
chained to the chair. He shut the door of the parlour 
once again and walked back to his room with an air of 
confidence.

But soon he was back again, unable to resist the
anticipation of the money that he was planning to 
trick them out of the next day. Okonkwo and Okeke 
snored. They were the greenest things he’d ever
come across, he thought! He already felt the seven
hundred and fifty pounds in the haversack in his
palms. Tomorrow, tomorrow, he thought, – and, shutting
the door gently, went to bed a rich man…

But when he went to greet his guests in the morning 
the room was empty!

In the lavatory of the ‘Up Limited’ train, Okonkwo and
Okeke were grooming themselves.

‘Free food, free lodging, and a gift of a hundred
pounds!’ Okonkwo was saying as he washed his face. 

‘When he was peeping in again and again, I thought he 
was going to be tough,’ said Okeke, as he rubbed his
chin before the mirror.

‘They will never learn,’ said Okonkwo as he wiped his 
face with a clean facecloth, he had taken out of his 
haversack. ‘They are as green as green peas, the whole
batch of them! See how they left the door only
bolted.’ 

He laughed out loud as he thought of the city folks’
greed that blinded them. Okonkwo and Okeke bantered
on as the train jogged along. Swaying on the handle 
of the door was their haversack, now emptied of the 
stones and old rags that had won them the hundred
pounds.
