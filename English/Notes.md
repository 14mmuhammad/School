### Short Stories - The Necklace
- The author talks about a "she" but never goes into her identity or go into
what her name is, but the author does go over the feelings of that person
and her family and what she has went through.

- It seems that "she" has gone through a lot of sufferings and has to do
a lot while fantasizing about a better life.

- Her house also seems to be in bad condition and from that we can deduce
that she and her husband are not really rich and she is very poor.

- The author also goes into saying that women shouldn't belong to some caste
system or something. 

- The person is definitely a dreamer
- It seems that the person also was not given much attention or had a 
lucky childhood since it says "She had no dresses, no jewels, nothing; and
these were the only things she loved. She felt she was made for them alone. She
wanted so much to charm, to be envied, to be desired and sought after."

- The author also talks about the person having one rich friend but she did
not visit because she suffered so much when she came home but whose home 
exactly?

- Looking at a very emotional conversation he had with his wife (the person who 
is being talked about in the whole story), it seems that her name is Mathilde

- The currency used in the place Mathilde is in, is Francs, that means 
probably a country in Europe, like Switzerland or France or maybe even an
African country like Rwanda

- Mathilde also borrowed her friend's necklace but lost it

- Apparently her husband's name is Loisel. 
- It seems that she lost her friend's necklace and now her and her husband
were panicking about it. 

- After checking in with so many jewellers, they found one who was
selling the exact same one for about 40,000 Francs

- Loisel, her husband had signed delas that took away a lot of his freedom
- It took 10 years to pay the debt of her husband.
- Apparently, the actual worth of the necklace was 500 Francs after 10 years
when Mathilde talked with her friend as the necklace was just an immitation

- These are the characteristics I would expect to see
- This knowledge helps me, the reader, to understand the story better. (EXPAND)

##### Q2
- This key element is the social status of the family of Mathilde & Loirel. 
It teaches us that people in a lower social status can do nothing except for
dream about a better financial status.

##### Q3
- It seems that Mathilde Loisel is a more of a dreamy character and not very
happy about her current status. She seems to think that she doesn't deserve
it and is very annoyed about it. She also seems to have thought about the 
future quite well. Meanwhile, her husband is more of an optimistic person, 
who, when he brings in the ticket, Mathilde starts crying and then her
husband asks her what is wrong to which she replies, what will I wear to this
event. It is obvious that the husband hadn't thought of this.

##### Q4
- The setting provides a big meaning to the story, if the story was set in
a financially rich or stable household then this wouldn't even be a story, 
as Mathilde and her husband could have bought a new necklace instantly and given
it back to Mathilde's friend

##### Q5
- There are multiple conflicts of the story as listed:
    - Bad financial status (from the eyes of Mathilde)
    - What will Mathilde wear to the event?
    - What jewellery will Mathilde wear to the event?
    - Mathilde has lost the necklace
    - Mathilde and her husband have to repay the debts

- The financial status of the couple is not resolved but apart from that
every other conflict is resolved over time and another one which isn't, 
is that she could have just been honest with her friend. (EXPAND)

##### Q6
- The theme of this story is being smart about what you choose to do and ensuring
that what ever you are going to do, you are prepared for it. For example, in the
text, her husband is very excited about the envelope/invitation when instead, 
he should have thought about what was going to happen and what his wife would 
need. (EXPAND)

##### Q7
- From the context, I can say that inscrutable means a very joyful smile since
in the paragraph it says inscrutable smile and most of the word choice is 
positive rather than negative 

- More like ununderstandable

##### Q8
- Awry or ruinous could be a synonym and Superb
