## Draft 1:
- __Name__                : Muhammad Ali
- __I Worked With__       : Romain Jacquard
- __Short Story__         : Once Upon A Time
- __Genre__               : Realistic Fiction  
- __Written By__          : Nadine Gordimer
- __How Do You Know This__: The story is based upon a 
very realistic setting and fits the condition of a 
story that is set in real life but there are some aspects
of it that make it a bit unreal. If this were to happen 
in real life, it would be widely known and be on the news

- __Format Of Adaptation__: 
- First person story according to the boy's perspective

- __Why Did You Choose This Format?__: 
- We chose this format because it would have been 
interesting to explore and do a story from the 
perspective of the child and we were actually getting
really into it but I think this format also
limited as in the vocabulary and the word choice we 
used as it is kind of a limitation. Therefore a perfect
challenge.

- __Audience__:
- Our audience was our class, meaning a teacher and
some classmates

- __Outline Who Did What?__:
- Romain did most of the writing while I cleaned up most 
of his writing and was like his editor. Â§I fixed up his
mistakes like spelling, fluency, better word choice, 
grammar mistakes. He fit his role perfectly as he is 
more of a very imaginative and a person who likes to 
think on their own, while I am a very critical thinking
kind of person

- __Rate Yourself On The Rubric__:
- I think I am 6-7

- __3 Things You Learned__:
1. First thing I learned is that you really need to be 
careful how you structure your story and from what 
perspective you are writing
2. Second thing I learned is that when you are writing 
from a perspective, you haev to think outside of the box and not necessarily from your own point of view. For 
example, since we were writing from the perspective of 
the child we couldn't just write with top-class 
vocabulary, we needed to use the vocabulary of a child
3. Editing is really important and if you are in a 
group, it is very important to have an editor
so that you can correct your or the author's mistakes
because you can be very surprised if you count
the mistakes

- __1 Thing You Learned About Group Work__:
- I learned that it is very important to have certain 
roles and stick to them

- __Glows__:
- I think my group really worked well in the fact that 
we simulated the effect of the story having been told
from the perspective of a child
- We also used a lot of descriptive writing and imagery 
in our writing which gave the feeling of the story 
happening before our eyes

- __Grows__:
- I think we could grow in fixing more of the grammar
and the communication between the group since Romain
added some more stuff which wasn't in the original 
written story and this had some errors.

## Draft 2:
- Hello, I am Muhammad Ali and today I am going to be reflecting
on me and my group's work for English. We were supposed to 
make anything like a letter, advertisement, poster..etc.. on 
a short story we read in class. I worked with Romain Jacquard
and we did the short story "Once Upon A Time" by Nadine Gordimer.
The genre of this short story is realistic fiction since it 
talks about a family who live in a bad and dangerous neighborhood
and because of this, the parents in the family start reinforcing
their house repeatedly in order to keep their son safe, but then,
after listening to a story, the son thinks that there is a 
"Sleeping Beauty" out there for him as well, since he listened
to a story related to it. That is when he starts to climb the 
gate and go through the barb wire which ends up killing him. 
Me and my partner know it is realistic fiction because the 
conditions of the story fit real life situations but the end,
if someone died like that, it would be on the news. 

We chose to write this story in first person format from the 
perspective of the boy. We thought that it would be the perfect
challenge to try to limit ourselves to simple vocabulary and
we ended up changing some parts of the story as well. 

The expected audience was to a matured audience as our story
was directed at 13+ year olds since it wouldn't really be good
if 10-12 year olds heard it. 

Most of the story was written by Romain as he is a very day-dreamy
person and he is very imaginative. He has also watched a ton of 
dramas so he knows the perfect story as well and he did add a 
plot twist. I wrote the conclusion and fixed the mistakes he made
like in grammar, or if the sentence didn't make sense. I fixed 
his word choice as well, and the spelling and the fluency so that
the story made more sense. We both fit our roles perfectly since
he is more of a story writer while I am a story editor.

If I were to rate myself on the rubric for the story, I would 
give myself a 5-6 and give Romain a 7 since he made the story A
LOT more interesting and engaging as initially it was just a 
simple google doc. 

3 things I learned from this project are:
1. You need to be careful about how you structure your story
and if your story is based off of another story, make sure
you understand the actual story properly first.
2. When you are writing from a point of view, you need to 
bring character into the story and make it actually feel like
it was written/told by that person like for example, in our
story, we came up with "balloon pops" instead of "gun shots"
to make it feel like a kid was telling the story.
3. Editing is really important, always have an editor in 
the group since you would be surprised how many mistakes the 
author makes

I think that the things that my group did very well are:
- Simulating the eeffect of the story having been written
or told from the perspective of a child
- Usage of a lot of descriptive writing as well as imagery 
to add to the story and make it more interesting and this
also made it feel like the story was happening right 
before our eyes.

Things that my group could work on are grammar and communication 
and presentation since the story was good but the presentation
wasn't the best. I definitely could have added a lot more life 
while I was presenting it and another thing would be how Romain
added some more stuff to the story without telling me to check and
this resulted in there being a lot of grammar mistakes as well as
some sentences that genuinely made no sense

## Draft 3
Me and my group were supposed to rewrite a short story in a
different form from its original one. I worked with Romain 
Jacquard and we did the short story, "Once Upon A Time" by 
Nadine Gordimer. The story is about a family who live in a 
bad neighborhood and in order to stay safe, the parents 
reinforce the house, but, after listening to the story, 
"The Sleeping Beauty", the son thinks that there is a "Sleeping 
Beauty" out there for him as well. That is when he starts to 
climb the reinforced gate and the barb wire on the gate 
eventually ends up killing him. The genre of the story is
realistic fiction as most of the conditions match real life
except some.

We chose to rewrite this story from the perspective of the boy. 
We thought that it would be the perfect challenge to try to limit
ourselves to simple vocabulary and we ended up changing some
parts of the story as well. 

The story was rewritten by Romain as he is a very imaginative
person and one of the places where he used his imagination is 
where he added a plot twist towards the end. Meanwhile, I fixed
the mistakes he made, improved word choice, fluency and made 
the story make more sense. We both fit our roles perfectly since 
he is more of a story writer while I am a story editor.

If I were to rate myself on the rubric for the story, I would give 
myself a 5-6 and give Romain a 7 since he made the story A LOT 
more interesting and engaging. 

Things I learned from this project are: Firstly, you have to 
choose an order in which you structure your story, especially 
if it is based off of another one. Secondly, you need to have a
plan and understanding of the story you are writing so it makes
sense. Thirdly, if you are writing from a perspective of another
character, you need to simulate the characteristics of that
character in your writing. Finally, always check the work, 
as you would be surprised how many mistakes you may make.

Things that my group did well were, using a lot of sensory and 
descriptive writing including things like imagery and we were 
successfully able to simulate the feeling that the story was told
by a kid. While, the things that we could improve are the grammar, 
communication and presentation of our project. I definitely could 
have added a lot more life into my voice while presenting the 
story and Romain could have told me to check for any mistakes in
some of the parts that he added before the presentation as there
were some mistakes that caused the story to be confusing.
