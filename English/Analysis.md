- In this analysis of a short story and its elements, I will be
analyzing the short story, "The Crooks", by Gabriel Okara. It is a 
story about 2 people who are walking towards a place called 
Idumota only to meet with a stranger who is a friend of their 
relatives. I will be analyzing the setting of the story, point of
view and the characterization and finally the conclusion.  

- Firstly, I will be going over the setting of the story. 
This story starts in a place called Lagos during an unspecified
time period. The protagonists, are said to have been on a bridge 
in Lagos where they just arrived from lorry just recently and going
towards Idumota. Proof of this can be seen in, "...as they walked 
along the bridge towards Idumota. They were two men who had 
apparently just arrived from the Provinces by lorry". Though the
time period is unspecified, we can try to judge from what we are 
told in the story, "They gaped at the lagoon and at the stream
of cars, motorcycles and  bicycles rushing in both directions". We 
know that motorcycles were not a big thing in the 1800s, so that
is not a possiblity. Another proof we can use "[The men] were startled
over and over again by the strident horns of the cars", horns became 
a popular thing during the early 1900s in America. The time period
of this story would therefore be around 1900s-2000s.


- Secondly, I will be going over the point of view the story is
written in. Throughout the story, it can be seen that the story is
written from a third-person perspective: "The two men stood out from
the crowd that they were walking through. Their hair was all brown
with dust...". Having read this we can easily state that this story is
written in third-person. 

- Thirdly and Finally, I will be going over the characterization 
that happens in the story. The characters I will be discussing are
the two men and the stranger they meet. During the start of the 
story we can tell that these two men are not familiar to the place 
from, "They were two men who had apparently just arrived..." 
They were just curious and surprised by the place we can deduct that 
from, "Their  eyes were wide with astonishment at the greatness of the
city..." Then we are introduced to the stranger, who says, 
"...'You stay for my place.'...", from this we can tell that he is a 
welcoming man as the travellers seem to know
one of the stranger's friend and he offers to let them stay at his 
place but then we also read what the stranger says behind their backs
to his friends, "'You see how them be?' he said after shutting the door.
'They be moo-moo and they get plenty money in that bag of theirs..'" and, 
"'Now listen  carefully to me, 'as I say to you before, we are going to 
play big with them. We go make them win hundred 'redboys'. When you wan' 
big fish you use big hook, and big  bait. So you know waiten you go do. Tomorrow
we go rich!'". From this part of the story we can tell that this man, is not 
one tht is hospitable but one that is greedy who only wants money. However, as the 
story goes on, we read, "'Free food, free lodging and a gift of a hundred pounds!'
Okonkwo was saying as he washed  his face". This is what we read after finding out
that they left the salon before the stranger could even ask them for anything, 
this shows that the one who was tricked was the stranger not the 2 men. I think a few
morals that can be learned from this story are, know what is 
going on around you, and don't take people for granted.

- Thank you for reading this analysis of a short story and
its elements, I hope you enjoyed and learned something new.

### Draft 2:
In this analysis of a short story and its elements, I will be analyzing the
short story, "The Crooks", by Gabriel Okara. The story is about 2 people who
are walking towards a place called  Idumota but on their way they meet with a
stranger who is a friend of their friend’s. I will be analyzing the setting of
the story, point of view and the theme.  

This story starts on a bridge in a place called Lagos during an unspecified
time period. The protagonists are said to have just arrived recently and are
going towards Idumota. Proof of this can be seen in, "...as they walked along
the bridge towards Idumota. They were two men who had apparently just arrived
from the Provinces by lorry". Though the time period is unspecified, we can try
to judge from what we are told in the story, "...at the stream of cars,
motorcycles and bicycles rushing in both directions". We know that
motorcycles were not a big thing in the 1800s. Another proof we can use,
"[The men] were startled over and over again by the strident horns of the
cars", horns became a popular thing during the early 1900s in America. The
time period of this story would therefore be around 1900s-2000s.

Moving on to the point of view the story is written in, it can be seen that the
story is written in a third-person omniscient perspective: "The two men stood
out from the crowd that they were walking through. Their hair was all brown
with dust...". This is obviously being told by a narrator

During the start of the story we can tell that these two men are not familiar
with the place, from the following, "They were two men who had apparently just
arrived..." They were just surprised by the place we can deduct that from,
"Their eyes were wide with astonishment at the greatness of the city..."
Then we are introduced to the stranger, who says, "...'You stay for my
place.'...", from this we can tell that he is a welcoming man as the
travellers seem to know one of the stranger's friends and he offers to let
them stay at his place but then we also read what the stranger says behind
their backs to his friends, “..‘They be moo-moo and they get plenty money
in that bag of theirs’...’’ From this part of the story we can tell that
this man is not one that is hospitable but one that is greedy who only
wants money. However, as the story goes on, we read, "'Free food, free
lodging and a gift of a hundred pounds!' Okonkwo was saying as he washed
his face". This is what we read after finding out that they left the salon
before the stranger could even ask them for anything. This shows that the
one who was tricked was the stranger not the 2 men.  I think a few morals
that can be learned from this story are, know what is going on around you,
and don't take people for granted.
